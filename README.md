# Silly Trivial React App

This is a simple, silly React app created to start learning React.

## Getting Started 

To run this app:

1. Install dependencies

    ```
    yarn --exact
    ```

2. Build the app

    ```
    yarn build
    ```
    
3. Start the dev server

    ```
    yarn dev
    ```

The shell should now tell you the URI where the app can be reached in your browser. 

This app doesn't do anything useful, it was just created as a starting point to learn React basics. To play, select the up arrow or the down arrow and click the "Place Bet" button. A random integer between 0 and 100 will be generated and you will be told if you won or not. The down arrow indicates a bet that the integer will be less than 50 and the up arrow indicates a bet that the integer will be equal to or greater than 50.
